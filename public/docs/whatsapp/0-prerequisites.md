### **What You Need to Create a WhatsApp Bot**

To create a WhatsApp bot using the WhatsApp Business API, you need the following:

1. **Meta Developers Account**  
   You must first create a Meta Developers account. This is required to access the Meta platform and utilize its products, including WhatsApp.

2. **Meta App with WhatsApp Product**  
   After creating a Meta app, you’ll need to add the **WhatsApp Business API** as a product to your app. This will allow your bot to interact with WhatsApp services.

3. **Phone Number**  
   You need to add and verify a phone number that your WhatsApp bot will use to send and receive messages. This number must be associated with your WhatsApp Business account.

4. **Access Token**  
   To authenticate API requests, you’ll need either a **temporary access token** (for testing purposes) or a **permanent access token** (for production). The token allows your bot to send and receive messages through the WhatsApp API.
